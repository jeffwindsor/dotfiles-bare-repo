** Domain and Co-Domain
Codomain: the codomain or set of destination of a function is the set into which all of the output of the function is constrained to fall.
so if we have a category X with a function f: X -> Y, then X is the domain and Y is CoDomain
** Epimorphism (Surjective in set theory) Function
a function which covers the whole co-domain
in set theory : for all y there exists an x where y = f x
in category theory we are focused on not how the functions maps points in the set but that a function maps all points, since we cannot see the points in CT.  So two differing functions that are both Epimorphisms of X to Y are the same

f is an epimorphismn from a to b ( f :: a -> b ), if For All c and every pair of morphisms (g1 ,g2) that go from b -> c.  if g1 . f = g2 . f it follows g1 = g2

** Monomorphism (Injective in set theory) Function
Does not collapse, There is a one to one mapping for f between X and Y

∀ c. ∀ g1, g2 :: c -> a.  f · g1 = f · g2 => g1 = g2 and f is a monomorphism
/For every c AND For all (g1, g2) that goes from c -> a, if f . g1 = f . g2 leads to g1 = g2/
Then f is a monomorphism

** IsoMorphism
is a structure-preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping
if a function is Epi and Mono it is an Isomorphism

given
    f :: a -> b
    g :: b -> a
then
    g . f = id of a
    f . g = id of b
    f is an Isomorphisms since there exists g

For finite sets iso-morphisms are one-to-one maps
For infinite sets, say between a set of Natural numbers and a set of Even numbers then f(x) = 2x creates an isomorphism

Reasons a function may not be an isomorphisms
- the values collapse like with the isEven f(x) = x % 2 == 0
    NOTE this sort of non-isomorphism is similar to ABSTRACTION
- the target set is larger than the source set, so it contains values that cannot be mapped back to the original set
    NOTE this is like modeling so maybe original set was a person in a cave and the co domain is there shadow on the world
