  + [X] Architecting for Availability and Fault Tolerance
    - Region contains Availability zones
      + Availability Zones are marked by sub-nets when launching EC2 instances
    - Virtual Machines (EC2)
      + Vertical Scaling: move EC2 from small instance to large instance
        - must restart instance to v-scale
      + Horizontal Scaling: adding a second server of same size (duplication)
        - auto scaling groups help with this
    - Managed Services: RDS, S3, DynamoDB, Elastic Load Balancers
      + Serverless: Website in S3 (push to Cloudfront), API Gateway, Lambda
    - Loss Coupling Architectures
      + Async Messaging: Web >> SQS >> Lambda >> Database
      + Microservice: each module is an separate application with a standard interface (say http)

  + [ ] Architecting Reliable Virtual Networks
    - VPC - virtual private network
      + Public Subnets act as DMZ for the VPC
        - NAT Gateway between Internet Gateway and Internal Subnets
      + Internet Gateway - virtual edge router
        - Route internet traffic to NAT-G
